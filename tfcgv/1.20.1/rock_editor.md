# Rock Editor

Allows for the editing and graphing (via this website) of the [rock layer settings](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.20.x/worldgen/world-preset/#rock-layer-settings) of the world through a GUI. This screen is divided into three tabs that focus on [rock settings](#rock-settings), the [layer types](#layer-types), and [layer definitions](#layer-definitions).

Additionally, across the bottom of the screen there are four buttons

- *Apply*: Validate the current settings and display a message if an issue occurs or apply the settings to the generator and return to the preview screen
- *Validate*: Validate the current settings
- *Graph*: Generate a link to view the current settings on the [rock graphing page](/mc/tools/tfcgv_rock_graph/)
- *Cancel*: Discard all edits to the settings and return to the preview screen

## Rock Settings

This tab is for editing, removing, and adding [rock settings](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.20.x/worldgen/world-preset/#rock). The tab is split into two sides, the left is a scrollable display of current rock settings and the right is the [editor](#rock-settings-editor) for rock settings.

Each entry in the display consists of

- A remove button: Removes the rock setting outright
- An edit button: Moves the rock setting to the editor
- The name of the rock setting
- The blocks which define the rock settings
