# 2.0.3

- Fix incompatibility with Sodium's `BiomeMixin`
- Add the ability to disable (and re-enable) the permissions system outright, allowing full access when disabled
    - This can be done using the `/tfcgenviewer disable_permissions` and `/tfcgenviewer enable_permissions` commands
- The permissions system for integrated servers (single player worlds) will now default to allowing players to see all visualizer types
- This update is network compatible with 2.0.1 and 2.0.2
