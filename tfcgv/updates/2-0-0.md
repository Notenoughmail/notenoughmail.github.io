# 2.0.0

- Update to 1.21.1!
- Complete rework to the underlying functionality; TFCGenViewer now has an API! Expect more on it in the docs at some point
- Several reworks to certain visualizer types
    - By default, The *Biomes* VT now shows a lot more biomes to match TFC's expanded biome palette
    - The *Inland Height* VT has been merged with *Biome Altitude*, which now shows 7 discrete altitudes from very deep ocean to mountain elevation
    - The *Rivers and Mountains* VT now has a flat land color, shows hot spot ages, and has a 'sensitivity' option for river positions
    - The *Rocks* VT now has two options
        - 'At surface': If the preview should be created for the surface rock layer
        - 'Elevation': The y-level the preview should be created for if 'at surface' is turned off
- Add the *Köppen Climate Classification* visualizer type, which colors land according to its [Köppen climate classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification)
- The mod is now properly server optional! Players can join servers without TFCGV without any issues, though naturally they will not be able to use the visualizer features
- The permissions system has received an overhaul allowing for more fine-grained control of visualizer permissions
- For the moment, the rock editor sub-screen is unimplemented
- The seed button now also puts the seed into the seed text box when clicked

**Note**: Currently the wiki is pretty barren and only has pages on using the new permission system and the json types used to define colors. More will be added as I have the time
