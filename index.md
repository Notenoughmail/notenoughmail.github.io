# NotEnoughMail's Stuff

Welcome!

This site is where I host most of my non-Discord online presence, it is mainly documentation for Minecraft mods, but I do write sometimes

## [Minecraft](mc/)

All of my Minecraft related stuff

## [Project Updates](updates/)

An archive for project updates

## [Writing](writing/)

Occasionally, I might write something, this is an archive for all of that

## [Links & Contact](contact/)

If for some reason you want to get in touch or otherwise find me elsewhere on the internet, this page should hopefully be helpful with that
