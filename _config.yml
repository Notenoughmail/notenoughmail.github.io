# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# TODO: Custom Ruby plugin/module/whatever-its-called that has updated JS highlighting
# Kramdown uses Rouge which is locked to 3.30.0 by GitHub Pages, but JS methods are not distinctly highlighted until 4.1.0...
# See https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/pull/1920/ for fix
# See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75903579/how-to-add-custom-language-syntax-highlighter-to-markdown-code-block-in-vscode for hacking VSC to work with the most reasonable implimentation of the above
# When doing the above, don't forget to change over {: .language-javascript } & ```js to the new language
