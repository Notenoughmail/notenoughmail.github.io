# 2.0.1

- Add dispatch gradient type
    - Only one dispatch type, `tfcgenviewer:hue_wheel`, currently exists
- The *Temperature* visualizer type now has tooltips in increments of 5°C, instead of 12°C
- The *Rainfall* VT now has tooltips in increments of 50mm, instead of 100mm
- The *Biomes*, *Rocks*, and *Climate Restricted Features* VTs now have dynamic color keys, only showing values encountered during generation
- VT specific options now have a teal border
- Tweaked the *Rocks* VT options
    - Changed 'at surface' to 'mode'; functionality is unchanged, but the wording should be more clear/descriptive
    - The 'elevation' option is now disabled if 'mode' is set to 'at surface'
- Add tooltips to all current VT options
- The configs now have lang entries
- [API]
    - VT specific options can now be dynamically disabled by passing a `BooleanSupplier` to `OptionProvider$Order#finish`
    - Add dispatch gradient registry, used by the above-mentioned dispatch gradient type
    - Add `RockCache`, a cache which
        - Wraps an inner cache, like `ClimateFeatureCache`
        - Keeps track of the colors in the rock color manager which have been encountered
        - Provides a color key describing the encountered colors
    - Add `ChunkSize` and `ChunkScale` for general use
- A new [demo video](https://youtu.be/RUc4P2T-jIs) for this update/2.0.0 in general
