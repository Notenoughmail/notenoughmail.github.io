# KubeJS TFC 2.0.0

- Update to 1.21.1, TFC 4.0.x, KubeJS 2101.7.2
- All features, in some form, as of 1.3.3 should be available, except as noted below
- Support for addons not yet ported is obviously not included
- Glass operations, food traits, climate models, and ISMs are now registries! They are no longer made through a custom event
- Custom chisel modes can now be registered
- Birthday modifications are no longer possible
- Container limiting now applies upon opening and closing menus
- There is no longer a jar item builder type
- Wild crops have been split into 4 builder types, similar to non-wild crops
- Crop model generation methods have been cut down to be much simpler and concise
- The climbing crop builder has been split from the double crop builder
- Configured & placed features are now made through builders in the `ServerEvents.registry` event instead of the `TFCEvents.worldgenData` event
    - This relies on an as-yet unmerged & unreleased PR to KubeJS to actually function
- TFC-specific recipe filters & component replacements are currently not implemented
- The sealable inventory attachment does not currently have the ability to function like vessels
- EntityJS, Firmalife compat is currently not included

**Note**: The Crop, bush, moss, and torch block builders have not been documented or tested. I will document them as I have the time to verify they function and/or release updates fixing issues with them. As such, until documented these builder types should be considered extra-beta: methods/functionality may change in a hotfix version without a deprecation cycle
