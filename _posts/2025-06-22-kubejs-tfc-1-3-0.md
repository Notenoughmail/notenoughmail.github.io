# KubeJS TFC 1.3.0

- Add commands to print TFC's level settings and chunk data
- Add setting (default enabled) to deduplicate TFC datapack validation errors that are inserted into the KubeJS console
- Add chunk generator type `kubejs_tfc:wrapped` which enables adding chunk data to levels without proper TFC-like level generators
- New event for creating chunk data, depends on above chunk generator type
- De-hardcode dead crop model generation
- Add `tfc:torch` block builder type
- Add `tfc:heat` block entity attachment type
- Add `tfc:calendar` block entity attachment type
- Deprecated:
    - `#drips` in `tfc:thin_spike` block type, same functionality handled by nullable parameter of `#dripParticle`
    - `#hasBubbles` & `#hasSteam` in `tfc:spring` fluid type, same functionality handled by nullable parameter of `#bubbleParticle` & `#steamParticle`
    - `#allModels` in berry bushes, superseded by `#models`
    - Deprecated methods in custom climate model event
- Remove old, non-functional chunk-data creation mechanism for custom climate models that was added in 1.2.6
- Add support for Kube's ingredient and result modifiers to TFC's advanced crafting recipes
- Fix drinkable description command printing the first effect in place of all-but-the-last effect
- Fix being unable to modify the cane block of spreading bushes
