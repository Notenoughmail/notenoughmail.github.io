# TFCGenViewer 1.5.0

- Add rock editor sub-screen
    - Can be opened via the "Edit Rocks" button below "Export Preview" in the preview screen
    - See the [wiki page](/tfcgv/1.20.1/rock-editor) for more information about usage
- Color gradients are now interpolated over the linear sRGB color space
- Changed the default gradients for the *Rainfall* and *Temperature* previewers to be more vibrant and distinct
    - As part of this, the `temp`, `temperature`, `rain`, and `rainfall` reference gradients are now separate from the `climate` gradient, which is now unused by default
- Adjust *Temperature* visualizer range to be -23 to 33 Â°C
