# TFCGenViewer 1.5.1

- Add *Climate Restricted Features* visualizer
    - By default shows Kaolin Clay and Coral spawn locations
    - Will display anything in the `tfcgenvewier:visualizable_features` placed feature tag
        - Can handle multiple, overlapping features gracefully
        - Uses the climate range set in the `tfc:climate` modifier of the feature
        - If the configured feature is a TFC ore-type, its biome tag will be respected
        - All entries also require a matching color definition in the `/tfcgenviewer/features/` folder
- Improve *Rivers and Mountains* and *Rocks* visualizer speeds, most noticeable with large visualization scales
