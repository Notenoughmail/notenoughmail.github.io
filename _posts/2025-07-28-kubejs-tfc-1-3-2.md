# KubeJS TFC 1.3.2

- Add `#hasPostProcess` and `#emissiveRendering` methods to extended properties
- Add fissure, forest, forest entry, overlay tree, random tree, stacked tree, and krummholz worldgen builders
- Add direct wrapper for TFC's `ItemStackProvider`
- Fix double crops not having yield multipliers in their loot tables
- Add convenience method for setting the dead model of torches
- Add TFC sapling & leaf block builders
- Rename several methods in crop block builders to prevent Rhino throwing a fit when used
    - `#productItem(ResourceLocation)` -> `#existingProductItem(ResourceLocation)`
    - `#model(number,Consumer)` -> `#setModel(number,Consumer)`
    - `#model(Consumer)` -> `#setModel(Consumer)`
- Allow `RecipeJS#getOriginalRecipeIngredients()` to work with TFC recipe types
- Add ability to change custom crop growth and expiry rates
- Add `always` and `never` shortcuts for extended property settings that take `StatePredicate`s
- Add tree solver command for modpack makers to easily make tree structures with proper states
- Add event for registering ISM -> json converters. All TFC, Firmalife, and TFCCC ISM types should be handled by default
- Add the ability to retrieve `NormalNoise`s during the chunk data provider creation event
- Adds sealable inventory attachment which applies a food trait to items within it
- "Fix" proto chunks with no `ChunkData` causing issues when promoted to level chunks with custom chunk data providers
