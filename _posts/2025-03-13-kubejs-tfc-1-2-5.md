# KubeJS TFC 1.2.5

- Fix faulty assumption that climate models will only be added to TFC-like worlds
- Slight rework to how custom climate models are created
    - 'Advanced' climate model functionality has been mered into the regular custom model
        - Along with this, there is now only a single `.register` method in the event, the previous registration methods are now deprecated
    - TFC climate default accessors have been moved from the event to the model builder callback
    - The wind vector callback now provides a `Level` and `BlockPos` instead of a `BlockContainerJS`
    - Custom noises are now created differently:
        - First, `.newNoise` is called with a callback where the noise can be modified, this returns an index
        - This index can be used in `.noise` to get the noise within calculation callbacks
- Spreading bush blocks are now tagged with `tfc:any_spreading_bush` by default, fixing max height being ignored and cane blocks breaking
- Add methods for setting the model and textures of bush blocks
- Cane block models are now named `<parent_id>_side_<lifecycle>_<stage>` to match TFC's model naming scheme, previously they were named `<parent_id>_cane_side_<lifecycle>_<stage>`
- Fix the use of `productItem` with a pre-existing item not working as it should
- Add `/kubejs_tfc search` command, enabling pack makers to determine which data entries are applied to an item/block/fluid
