# Port-in-Orbit Olwicks-2

A collection of stories set within and around the titular orbital station, primarily focused on Driscoll, pilot of the *I.R.S.R.V. Zanjero*; poor conversationalist; and Ghost.

Originally, this series started as responses to prompts made by [@make-up-a-starship-pilot](https://web.archive.org/web/20250106211117/https://cohost.org/make-up-a-starship-pilot?page=0) on the late cohost.

This series is also part of larger collection of works known as the [Progenitology Universe](../progenitology/), sharing the technologies, locations, and history thereof.
