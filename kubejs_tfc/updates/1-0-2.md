# KubeJS TFC 1.0.2

- Fix an issue with delegate recipe types attempting to reference their id when generating their id
- Add douse fire event
- Rework how rock layers are defined
    - The event has been renamed from `registerRockSettings` to just `rockSettings`
    - The `defineLayer` method now takes each block individually instead of altogether as a consumer
    - `defineLayer` now returns the `RockSettings` object created
