# Data

KubeJS TFC allows users to easily write some of TFC's [custom data](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.18.x/data/custom/) types without having to directly write json files

In the `tfc.data` event there are methods for:

- [Damage Resistances](#damage-resistances)
    - [Item](#item-damage-resistance)
    - [Entity](#entity-damage-resistance)
- [Drinkables](#drinkables)
- [Fertilizers](#fertilizers)
- [Food Items](#food-items)
- [Fuels](#fuels)
- [Heats](#heats)
- [Item Size](#item-size)
- [Lamp fuels](#lamp-fuels)
- [Metals](#metals)
- [Supports](#supports)
- [Sluicing](#sluicing)
- [Panning](#panning)
- [Climate Ranges](#climate-ranges)
- [Fauna](#fauna)

There is also support for [FirmaLife](https://modrinth.com/mod/firmalife) and [Beneath](https://github.com/eerussianguy/Beneath/tree/v1.0.3-alpha) custom data types as well

- [FirmaLife Greenhouses](#greenhouses)
- [FirmaLife Plantables](#plantables)
- [Beneath Nether Fertilizers](#nether-fertilizers)

Additionally, the ability to access and manipulate some of the non-datapack accessible data TFC adds to the player can be accessed from a `PlayerJS` object in scripts. See [below](#attached-tfc-data) for specifics

# Damage Resistances

See the [main page](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.18.x/data/custom/#damage-resistances)!

TFC has two different types of damage resistance, item and entity

## Item Damage Resistance

- 1st argument: An item ingredient, which the resistances will apply to
- 2nd argument: A string which determines the resistances and their values
    - The format is `p=20, crushing=40`; the different types of damage *must* be separated by commas, negative values are allowed, and the types may be shortened to just their first letter:
        - piercing/p
        - slashing/s
        - crushing/c
- *optional 3rd argument*: A `ResourceLocation` which determines the name/file of the resistance, if not provided a name will be automatically generated based on the ingredient

### Example

```js
// Gives diamond leggings very high resistance against piercing and a slight weakness against crushing
onEvent('tfc.data', event => {
    event.addTFCItemDamageResistance('minecraft:diamond_leggings', 'p=1000000, c=-50')
})
```

## Entity Damage Resistance

- 1st argument: An entity tag, which the resistances will apply to
- 2nd argument: A string which determines the resistances and their values
    - The format is `p=20, crushing=40`; the different types of damage *must* be separated by commas, negative values are allowed, and the types may be shortened to just their first letter:
        - piercing/p
        - slashing/s
        - crushing/c
- *optional 3rd argument*: A `ResourceLocation` which determines the name/file of the resistance, if not provided a name will be automatically generated based on the ingredient

### Example

```js
// Makes land prey slightly strong against crushing damage and weak towards piercing damage
onEvent('tfc.data', event => {
    event.addTFCEntityDamageResistance('tfc:land_prey', 'c=20, p=-3000')
})
```

Using the example below, the metal will be `kubejs_tfc:minecraft_water`, and the texture location will be `kubejs_tfc:textures/block/metal/full/minecraft_water.png`

Alternatively put `settings.dataPackOutput = true` at the top of your script file and when entering the world or using `/reload` KubeJS will print the location of the virtual file, which can be used to determine the names as well, as well as its contents to the log

## Example

```js
// Makes water melt at 0℃, heat up slowly with iron ingots as the ingot item and gold ingots as the sheet item
onEvent('tfc.data', event => {
