# Events

KubeJS TFC adds several JS events for use in your scripts

- [Rock Settings]({% link kubejs_tfc/1.18.2/worldgen.md %}#rock-layers)
- [Limiting Containers](#limiting-containers)
- [Register Climate Model](#register-climate-model)
- [Select Climate model](#select-climate-model)
- [Start Fire](#start-fire)
- [Prospect](#prospect)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Animal product](#animal-product)
- [Collapse](#collapse)

It is highly recommended to use [ProbeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/probejs) when working with these

# Limiting Containers

This event can be used in the `startup_scripts` folder.

TFC has an item size feature which it uses to limit which items can go into its containers. KubeJS TFC allows you to somewhat replicate this for other mod's containers, with some limitations:

- It will only be able to apply to a container which registers a MenuType
- It only applies to player interactions
- It only applies upon *closing* a menu

The basic functionality of this is based off of a 1.12 [addon](https://github.com/DoubleDoorDevelopment/OversizedItemInStorageArea) that did much the same. It is licensed under the [BSD License](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oversized-item-in-storage-area/comments#license)

Upon a player closing a limited container any items that are (1) in the limited slots and (2) greater than the provided size will be removed from the container and spawned in world around the player

## Usage

This is available through a new startup event, `tfc.limit_container_size`, with a single method, `limitContainerSize`, available

- 1st argument: A string, the registry name of a menu
    - A full list of available menus can be found by running the command `/kubejs dump_registry minecraft:menu` in-game
- 2nd argument: A string, the maximum size of items allowed in the declared slots
    - Valid values:
        - tiny
        - very_small
        - small
        - normal
        - large
        - very_large
        - huge
- *optional 3rd argument*: An integer array, representing the specific range of indexes of the container's slots which should be limited, defaults to all slots in the container
    - This will accept any multiple of 2 number of integers (i.e. {0, 2} or {1, 3, 5, 7})

## Examples

```js
onEvent('tfc.limit_container_size', event => {
    // Limits the hopper to only have normal or smaller item sizes
    event.limitContainerSize('minecraft:hopper', 'normal')
    // Limits shulker boxes to very small or smaller items for slots 0 through 8 and 18 through 26
    event.limitContainerSize('minecraft:shulker_box', 'very_small', 0, 8, 18, 26)
})
```

# Register Climate Model

This event can be used in the `startup_scripts` folder

TFC implements local temperature and rainfall, this is done through the use of climate models. This event has two methods `registerClimateModel` and `registerAdvancedClimateModel`. Both events take a resource location, the name of the model being registered, and a climate model consumer, which defines how your custom model behaves; the second method has the ability to set custom behaviors on world and chunk load in its consumer.

## Consumer

- `.setCurrentTemperatureCalculation(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets the calculation for current temperature at a position. The callback provides:
    - A `LevelReader`, the level
    - A `BlockPos`, the position
    - A `Long`, the calendar ticks
    - An `Integer`, the number of days in a month
    - And expects a number
- `.setAverageTemperatureCalculation(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets the calculation for the average temperature at a position. The callback provides:
    - A `LevelReader`, the level
    - A `BlockPos`, the position
    - And expects a number
- `.setAverageRainfallCalculation(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets the calculation for the average rainfall at a position. The callback provides:
    - A `LevelReader`, the level
    - A `BlockPos`, the position
    - And expects a number between 0 and 500
- `.setAirFog(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets the fogginess at a position and time. The callback provides:
    - A `LevelReader`, the level
    - A `BlockPos`, the position
    - A `Long`, the calendar ticks
    - And expects a number between 0 and 1
- `.setWaterFog(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets the water fogginess at a position and time. The callback provides:
    - A `LevelReader`, the level
    - A `BlockPos`, the position
    - A`Long`, the calendar ticks
    - And expects a number between 0 and 1
- `.getClimateSeed()`{: .language-javascript }: Returns the climate seed, a number based on the level's seed
- `.getNewNoise()`{: .language-javascript }: Returns an OpenSimplex2D noise generator.
- `.getTemperatureSettings()`{: .language-javascript }: Returns the level's temperature [climate settings](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.18.x/worldgen/dimension/#climate-settings), or the default if none
- `.getRainfallSettings()`{: .language-javascript }: Returns the level's rainfall climate settings, or default if none
- `averageTemperature`:Returns a reference to the model's average temperature calculation, use `getValue(LevelReader, BlockPos)` to get its value
- `averageRainfall`:Returns a reference to the model's average rainfall calculation, use `getValue(LevelReader, BlockPos)` to get its value
- `currentTemperature`:Returns a reference to the model's current temperature calculation, use `getValue(LevelReader, BlockPos, Long, Int) to get its value
- `airFog`:Returns a reference to the model's air fog calculation, use `getValue(LevelReader, BlockPos, Long)` to get its value
- `waterFog`:Returns a reference to the model's water fog calculation, use `getValue(LevelReader, BlockPos, Long)` to get its value

If registering an advanced model the following are also available

- `.setOnWorldLoad(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets what should be done upon the world loading. The callback provides:
    - A `ServerLevel`, the level
- `.setOnChunkLoad(callback)`{: .language-javascript }: Sets what should be done upon a chunk loading, by default this is only called during world generation and TFC's update climate command. The callback provides:
    - A `WorldGenLevel`, the level
    - A `ChunkAccess`, the chunk
    - A `ChunkData`, the chunk's TFC data

## Examples

```js
onEvent('tfc.climate_model.register', event => {
    event.registerClimateModel('kubejs:my_model', model => {
        model.setAverageTemperatureCalculation((level, pos) => {
            return (pos.x + pos.z) / 2000 + (pos.y / 60)
        })
        model.setAirFog((level, pos, calendarTicks) => {
            return JavaMath.sin(Calendar.getCalendar(level).getCalendarDayTime() / 12000 * JavaMath.PI);
        })
    })
    event.registerAdvancedClimateModel('kubejs:my_advanced_model', model => {
         model.setOnWorldLoad(level => {
             console.log(`Loading into dimension: ${level.dimension}`)
         })
    })
})
```

# Select Climate Model

This event can be used in the `startup_scripts`or `server_scripts` folders. It can be reloaded at any time.

TFC implements local temperature and rainfall, this is done through the use of climate models. Whenever a world is loading or selecting its climate model, this event is fired. It is only fired on the server.

## Methods

    event.getLevel()
    event.getModel()
    event.setModel('kubejs:my_model')
})
```

# Start Fire

This event can be used in the `startup_scripts` or `server_scripts` folders. It can be reloaded at any time. It can be cancelled.

TFC uses this event for lighting fires or optionally light-able blocks. This event *should* be cancelled if it was handled here. If you want your items to act like Flint and Steel or Torches, add them to either the `tfc:starts_fires_with_items` tag or the `tfc:starts_fires_with_durability` tags.

## Methods

         event.cancel()
    }
}) 
```

    }
})
```

# Animal Product

This event can be used in the `startup_scripts` or `server_scripts` folders. It can be reloaded at any time. It can be cancelled.

This event is fired whenever a sheep is sheared, a cow is milked, or similar action happens, cancelling it will prevent the default behavior, which is controlled by each entity's implementation. This event does not control if an entity can give products, it is for the sole purpose of modifying/blocking what happens when products are made.

This event has a product, it may either be an ItemStackJS or a FluidStackJS, not both. Only the non-empty type will retain modifications, attempting to change the type will void the the original product.

         event.cancel()
    }
})
```
